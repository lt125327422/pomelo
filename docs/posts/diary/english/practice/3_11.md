现在的海关官员往往相当宽容。但是，当你通过绿色通道，没有任何东西需要申报时，他们仍可以拦住你。
甚至是最诚实的人也常被弄得觉得有罪似的，而老练的职业走私犯即使在手提箱里藏着500只金表，却也处之
泰然。最近一次，我出国归来，碰上一位特别好管闲事的年轻海关官员，他显然把我当成了走私犯。
“您有什么需要申报的吗？”他直盯着我的眼睛问。
“没有。”我自信地回答说。
“请打开这只手提箱好吗？”
“好的。”我回答说。
那位官员十分仔细地把箱子检查了一遍。所有细心包装好的东西一会儿工夫就乱成了一团。我相信那箱子
再也关不上了。突然，我看到官员脸上露出了得意的神色。他在我的箱底发现了一只小瓶，高兴地一把抓了起
来。
“香水，嗯？”他讥讽地说道，“你刚才应该申报，香水要上进口税的。”
“不，这不是香水，”我说，“是发胶。”接着我脸带微笑补充说：“这是一种我自己配制的奇特的混合物。”
果不出所料，他并不相信我。
“你就闻一闻吧！”我催促说。
海关官员拧：开瓶盖，把瓶子放到鼻子底下。一股怪味袭来，使他相信了我说的是真话。几分钟后，我终于被
放行，手提划着宝贵的粉笔记号的行李，匆匆离去。
the officer went through  the case with great care
all the things I had packed so carefully were soon in a dreadful mess
i felt sure that i would never be able to close the case again

suddenly I saw the officer's face  light up , he found a little bottle in my case bottom
he had spotted a tiny bottle in the bottom of my suitcase and he pounces on it with delight

perfume eh , he asked sarcastically , you should have declared that , perfume is not exempt from import duty
but it's not perfume, i said it's hair gel , then I added with a smile 
it's a strange mixture I make myself
as I expected , he did not believe me
try it, i said encouragingly
the custom officer unscrewed the cap and put the bottle to his nostril
he was agreed by an unpleasant smell which convinced him that I was telling the truth
a few minutes later , i was able to hurry away with precious chalk marks on my baggage

unscrewed the cap
put the bottle to his nose
he was agreed by an unpleasant smell which convinced him that I was telling the truh

would you mind unlocking this suitcase please
not at all , i answer

go through
had packed sth
be in dreadful mess
I feel sure
be + adj + that + 
I feel sure that i would never be able to close the case again


that officer check this case carefully
everything i carefully warp up once get mess
I think it's impossible to close that case again


customs officer quite tolerant these days

but they can still stop you when you are going through the green channel and have nothing to declare
even really the holiest people also made to feel guilty
the hardened professional smuggler ,on the other hand, is never trouble by such feelings
even if he has five hundred gold watch hidden in his suitcase

when I return from abroad recently, 
a particularly officious young custom clearly regard me as a smuggler 

have you anything to declare? he asked with looking me in eye
nothing I reply with confidence
no I answered with confidently
please open this suitcase,
would you mind unlocking this suitcase please
not at all ,  I replied
