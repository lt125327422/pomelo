one man stayed at the wheel while two others with black stockings over their faces jumped out the car 
and smashed the windows of the shop with iron bars
while this was going on , mrs taylor was upstairs
he and his staff began throwing furniture out of the window, chairs amd tables went flying into the arcade street
