我们许多人对于荒岛生活有一种不切实际的想法。我们有时想像荒岛是阳光终日普照的天堂。在那里，生
活简单又美好。成熟的水果从树上掉下来，人们根本无需劳动。另一种想法恰恰相反，认为荒岛生活很可怕，要
么饿死，要么像鲁滨孙那样，天天盼船来，却总不见船影。也许，这两种想像都有可信之处。但很少有人能有机
会去弄个究竟。
最近有两个人在一座珊瑚岛上呆了5天，他们真希望在那儿再多呆一些日子。他们驾着一条严重损坏的小
船从维尔京群岛去迈阿密修理。途中船开始下沉，他们迅速把食物、火柴、罐装啤酒往一只救生筏上装。然
后在加勒比海上划行了几英里，到了一座珊瑚岛上。岛上几乎没有一棵树，也没有淡水，但这不算什么问题。他
们用橡皮艇蓄积雨水。由于他们随身带了一支捕鱼枪，因此，吃饭不愁。他们天天捕捉龙虾和鱼，正如其中一位
所说，吃得“像国王一样好”。5天后，一条油轮从那儿路过.搭救了他们。这二位不得不离开那个荒岛时、还真
的感到遗憾呢！

but few of us have had an opportunity to find it out
