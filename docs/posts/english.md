Two factors weigh heavily against the effectiveness of scientific research in industrial. 

one is the general atmosphere of secrecy in which it is carried out, the other is the lack of freedom of the individual research worker.
---
any research involving secrecy, 
in so far as any inquiry is a secret one
---
the individual research workers are engaged in are limited from 
it naturally limit all those engaged in carrying it out from effective contact with their fellow scientists.

the degree of secrecy naturally varies considerably.
some of the bigger firms are engaged in researches which are of such general and fundamental nature that ti is a positive advantage to them not to keep their secret

yet a great many processes depending on such research are sought for with complete secrecy until the stage
at which patents can be taken out.

even more processes are never patented at all but kept as secret processes.

people are always talking about the problem of youth. if there is one - which I take leave to doubt- then it's the older people who
create it, not the young themselves. let us get down to the fundamentals and agree that the young are after all human beings - people just like their older
there is only one difference between old man and young one: the yong man have have glorius future before him and the old one has a splendid future 
behind him: and maybe that is where the rub is.

modern sculpture rarely surprises us anymore, the idea that modern art only can be seen in museums is wrong/mistake.

even these people who are not interested in art have trouble in not noticing modern arts which are shown at public place

even people who take no interest in art cannot have failed to notice examples of modern sculpture which is on display in public places 


there are many stranger sculptures at park, edifice and shop. for these, we already do not feel amazing anymore 

strange forms stand in gardens and outside buildings and shops. we have got quite used to them.


some so-called art has displayed at here about eighty years.

some so-called modern pieces have been on display for nearly eighty years.


in spite of this, the exhabit which is hold in recently make some people including me suprise. 

in spite of this, some people including me were surprised by a recent exhibition of modern sculpture  


the first thing I saw when I entered the art gallery was a notice which said:'don't touch the exhibits. some of them are dangerous.'

the objects on display were pieces of moving sculpture. 
oddly shaped forms that are suspended from the ceiling and move in response to a gust of wind are quite familiar to everybody


these objects, however, were different.

lined up against the wall, there were long thin wires attached to metal spheres. 


the idea that wealthy is equal to happy is totally wrong.

the metal spheres had been magnetized and attracted and repelled each other all the time.

in the center of the hall, there were a number of tall structures which contained colored lights.

these lights flickered continuously like traffic lights which have gone mad. 

sparks were emitted from small black boxes.

red lamps flashed on and off angrily. 

it was rather like an exhibition of prehistoric electronic equipment.

these peculiar forms not only seemed designed to shock people emotionally, but to give them electric shocks as well.


these lumps flickered continuously
